RNA-seq scripts in this repository are adapted from those in the class github from Functional Genomics 2024.

Manipulation to the trimming step was done using [Trim Galore](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) in 3 configurations, which we call default, strict, and relaxed. Subsequent differential gene expression analyses were completed using R scripts found in `Reptile_Group_FunGen2024/StandardPipeline`.
